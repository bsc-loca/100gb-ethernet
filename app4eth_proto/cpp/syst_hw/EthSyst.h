* The Xilinx Ethernet Lite (EmacLite) driver. This driver supports the Xilinx
* Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC (EmacLite).
*
* The Xilinx Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC supports the following features:
*   - Media Independent Interface (MII) for connection to external
*     10/100 Mbps PHY transceivers
*   - Independent internal transmit and receive buffers
*   - CSMA/CD compliant operations for half-duplex modes
*   - Unicast and broadcast
*   - Automatic FCS insertion
*   - Automatic pad insertion on transmit
*   - Configurable ping/pong buffers for either/both transmit and receive
*     buffer areas
*   - Interrupt driven mode
*   - Internal loop back
*   - MDIO Support to access PHY Registers
*
* The Xilinx Ethernet Lite 10/100 MAC does not support the following features:
*   - multi-frame buffering
*     only 1 transmit frame is allowed into each transmit buffer,
*     only 1 receive frame is allowed into each receive buffer.
*     the hardware blocks reception until buffer is emptied
*   - Pause frame (flow control) detection in full-duplex mode
*   - Programmable inter frame gap
*   - Multicast and promiscuous address filtering
*   - Automatic source address insertion or overwrite
*
* <b>Driver Description</b>
*
* The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
* communicate to the EmacLite. The driver handles transmission and reception
* of Ethernet frames, as well as configuration of the controller. It does not
* handle protocol stack functionality such as Link Layer Control (LLC) or the
* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). The protocol stack that makes use of the
* driver handles this functionality. This implies that the driver is simply a
* pass-through mechanism between a protocol stack and the EmacLite.
*
* Since the driver is a simple pass-through mechanism between a protocol stack
* and the EmacLite, no assembly or disassembly of Ethernet frames is done at
* the driver-level. This assumes that the protocol stack passes a correctly
* formatted Ethernet frame to the driver for transmission, and that the driver
* does not validate the contents of an incoming frame. A single device driver
* can support multiple EmacLite devices.
*
* The driver supports interrupt driven mode and the default mode of operation
* is polled mode. If interrupts are desired, XEmacLite_InterruptEnable() must
* be called.
*
* <b>Device Configuration</b>
*
* The device can be configured in various ways during the FPGA implementation
* process.  Configuration parameters are stored in the xemaclite_g.c file.
* A table is defined where each entry contains configuration information for an
* EmacLite device. This information includes such things as the base address
* of the memory-mapped device and the number of buffers.
*
* <b>Interrupt Processing</b>
*
* After _Initialize is called, _InterruptEnable can be called to enable the
* interrupt driven functionality. If polled operation is desired, just call
* _Send and check the return code. If XST_FAILURE is returned, call _Send with
* the same data until XST_SUCCESS is returned. The same idea applies to _Recv.
* Call _Recv until the returned length is non-zero at which point the received
* data is in the buffer provided in the function call.
*
* The Transmit and Receive interrupts are enabled within the _InterruptEnable
* function and disabled in the _InterruptDisable function. The _Send and _Recv
* functions acknowledge the EmacLite generated interrupts associated with each
* function.
* It is the application's responsibility to acknowledge any associated Interrupt
* Controller interrupts if it is used in the system.
*
* <b>Memory Buffer Alignment</b>
*
* The alignment of the input/output buffers for the _Send and _Recv routine is
* not required to be 32 bits. If the buffer is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary
* there will be a performance impact while the driver aligns the data for
* transmission or upon reception.
*
* For optimum performance, the user should provide a 32-bit aligned buffer
* to the _Send and _Recv routines.
*
* <b>Asserts</b>
*
* Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument
* values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining, at
* compile time, the NDEBUG identifier.  By default, asserts are turned on and it
* is recommended that application developers leave asserts on during
* development.
*
* @note
*
* This driver requires EmacLite hardware version 1.01a and higher. It is not
* compatible with earlier versions of the EmacLite hardware. Use version 1.00a
* software driver for hardware version 1.00a/b.
*
* The RX hardware is enabled from powerup and there is no disable. It is
* possible that frames have been received prior to the initialization
* of the driver. If this situation is possible, call XEmacLite_FlushReceive()
* to empty the receive buffers after initialization.
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works
* with physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management,
* threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must
* be satisfied by the layer above this driver.

* 1.12a mta  11/28/07 Added the function XEmacLite_CfgInitialize,
*		      moved the functions XEmacLite_LookupConfig and
*		      XEmacLite_Initialize to xemaclite_sinit.c for removing
*		      the dependency on the static config table and
*		      xparameters.h from the driver initialization
* 1.13a sv   02/1/08  Updated the TxBufferAvailable routine to return
*		      busy status properly and added macros for Tx/Rx status

*		      file
* 2.00a ktn  02/16/09 Added support for MDIO and internal loop back
* 2.01a ktn  07/20/09 Updated the XEmacLite_AlignedWrite and

*                     the interrupt in the Ping buffer as this is used to enable
*                     the interrupts for both Ping and Pong Buffers.
*                     The interrupt enable bit in the Pong buffer is not used by

*		      functions  are updated to support little endian
*		      MicroBlaze.
* 3.02a sdm  07/22/11 Removed redundant code in XEmacLite_Recv functions for
*		      CR617290
* 3.03a asa  04/05/12 Defined the flag __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ for cases where the
*		      driver is compiled with ARM toolchain.

*                     strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
*                     for CR-965028.
